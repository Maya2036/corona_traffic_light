The traffic light uses a digital distance sensor to detect if the button is pressed. 

My setup uses:
Arduino Uno
Red and green LEDs as well as transistor (BC337)
Yellow LED for sensor indicator 
220ogm resisitors for the LEDs
USB cable and phone charger (5v, 1A)
A digital distance sensor, GP2Y0D810Z0F.
